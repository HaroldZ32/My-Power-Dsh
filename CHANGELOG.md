# Changelog

Human-readable release notes. Format: one section per released version, newest first. This file is
English-only and is NOT part of the bilingual docs band (AGENTS.md Language policy polices `docs/**`,
`packages/*/README.md`, `extensions/**`, `templates/**` and the root `README`).

## v0.10.1 — the session-start gate really fires

Two functional defects were measured AFTER v0.10.0 was tagged, by lanes whose verification went deeper
than the release sweep did. Both are fixed here; the full account is in
`docs/plan-0.1.7-adaptation.md` §7.

**Fixed.**

- **The session-start complexity gate was MOUNTED but NEVER FIRED.** Three root causes, each measured
  on a real boot: (a) `agent/pre-step` is dispatched through the AGENT's scope carrier and `dsh-scope`
  drops a listener registered on a row's ctx, so the handler was never invoked; (b) the harness splices
  its own user-role runtime-context turn onto the pre-step decision, so the gate judged that snapshot
  instead of the goal; (c) the injected notice used the retired `{kind:"plugin"}` message source, which
  harness 0.1.7's format-v4 gate REFUSES — the injection killed the boot. The gate now registers one
  listener per qualifying agent in that agent's own scope through a new adapter seam
  (`registerAgentPreStep`), reads the goal from the payload's raw claimed list, and names its own
  message producer. The frozen properties are unchanged: advisory only, the marker
  `[AgentTeams] Session-start team rule`, the predicate A/B/C/D, mpd-preset scope, settle once,
  contained failure.
- **`/ulw` used the same fatal message source.** A lane-wide grep prompted by the first fix found
  `mpd-ulw-plugin` emitting `{kind:"plugin"}` for its activation directive; it now uses a
  producer-owned kind, and the adapter's doc comment no longer teaches the retired spelling.

**Tests.**

- `skills/dsh-qa/scripts/session-start-team.mjs` now splits its live verdict into named
  sub-assertions and asserts the boot's own session-store key plus the row's `sessionGate=advisory`
  report, so "the gate was never mounted" and "the gate is mounted and did not fire" are different
  readings with different owners. Its earlier green was partly vacuous on 3 of 6 sides; that is fixed,
  and it now passes with `simpleNotices [0,0,0]`, `softNotices [1,1]`, `explicitNotices [1]`, every
  triggered side staging nothing.
- A regression test drives the gate through the REAL adapter with the REAL payload shape — no `agent`
  field — which is the test whose absence let this ship.

## v0.10.0 — full adaptation to DeepSeek Harness 0.1.7-rc.2

The harness replaced two things this bundle was built on, and this release follows both.

**Breaking changes (harness 0.1.7-rc.2).**

- **The preset model was replaced.** `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets` no longer exists: the deployment
  default now lives on `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset-registry`, and a preset is an ordinary plugin
  ROW (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset`) whose `config.plugins` carries the child entry list inline.
  The `mpd` preset is therefore declared by `presets/mpd.patch.yml` (row `preset-mpd`), the bundle
  id-targets `agent-preset-registry` to `{ default: mpd }`, and the manifest's `dsh.bundle.patch`
  became an ARRAY of two patch files. The retired directory form
  (`presets/mpd/{preset.yml,agent.cordis.yml}`) is gone; `@deepseek-ai/dsh-workflow-worker-thread`
  went with it and the preset now declares `workflow-ptc`, matching the shipped `standard` preset.
- **Agent Teams became an official plugin set.** The bundle now mounts
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team` (+ `-tool-agent-team`, `-client-ui-agent-team`) and the
  model-facing interface is `spawn_teammate` / `send_message` / `list_agents` / `wait_agent` /
  `interrupt_agent` / `team_task_*`. The vendored third-party body
  (`packages/mpd-agent-teams-plugin`, its `agent_teams_*` tools, its `.mpd/team` record and its Web
  activity panel) is RETIRED from the composition and kept in the tree for one release as a declared
  follow-up deletion.
- **Every agent-team interaction goes through `mpd-dsh-adapter`.** The adapter gained a team plane
  (`teamService` / `teamMembership` / `teamListMembers` / `teamListTasks` / `teamCreateTask` /
  `teamGetTask` / `teamUpdateTask` / `teamSendMessage` / `teamSpawnTeammate` / `teamInterrupt` /
  `teamWaitForChange` / `teamLiveTeams` / `registerSubagentProvider`), and a new gate
  (`packages/mpd-dsh-adapter-plugin/test/no-direct-team-access.test.mjs`) fails on a direct
  `ctx.agentTeams` / `subagents.startContinuable` reference anywhere outside the adapter.

**Capability bound, stated plainly.** `TeamService.spawnTeammate` forwards only `{ prompt, parent }` to
`ctx.subagents.startContinuable`, so a teammate created by `spawn_teammate` inherits the Lead's model
route: per-teammate model routing is impossible on the official plugin. The `teamModels.slot*` settings
keep applying to the one-shot consult paths (`mpd_role_spawn`, `mpd_workmate_spawn`), which pass an
explicit route. The roster's mechanical read-only discipline is preserved by a tool guard, and the
session-start complexity gate is re-implemented on the official seams by `mpd-roles-plugin`.

**Added.**

- A Docker end-to-end client test: `docker/Dockerfile` (ubuntu:24.04) + `docker/docker-compose.yml` +
  `docker/entrypoint.sh`, driven by `node scripts/docker-e2e.mjs`, which installs Node 24, bun and
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.7-rc.2` into a clean Ubuntu 24.04 machine, runs the real
  `dsh plugin --profile web add .`, and asserts a mounting boot plus a `session/create` preset mount.
  See `docker/README.md` for what it proves and what it does not.
- `docs/plan-0.1.7-adaptation.md` — the adoption record: measured baseline, the harness changes, the
  decisions, the lanes, and the retired assertions.

**Fixed.**

- `mpd-bootstrap-plugin`'s legacy home-copy cleanup recognised only the retired directory spelling of
  a bundle preset, so a stamped `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/mpd` copy survived a boot that was supposed
  to remove it. Both spellings are now recognised.
- `buildToolchain` is recorded as the bun actually used (`bun@1.4.0`) and every committed `dist/` was
  rebuilt from the canonical repo-root command, so `verify-dist-fresh` is green again.
