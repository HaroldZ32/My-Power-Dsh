// mpd-roles-plugin: the specialists live as a SPECIALIST ROSTER, not as
// presets. Each role = { stable id (chain key), normal display name, persona
// text, DeepSeek model chain, read-only discipline }. Consumers: mpd_role_spawn
// (one-shot specialist from anywhere), mpd_role_persona (text for spawn
// surfaces like agent_teams_add_member), and the mpdRoles service (mpd-modelchain
// chain lookup). Team mode lives in the adopted dsh-agent-teams plugin, whose
// normal-named member templates are configured in the bundle patch.
// ADDRESSING CONTRACT: a role is addressed by its normal display NAME — the member
// name in team mode, the label of a one-shot mpd_role_spawn, and what every
// description/render lists. The stable `id` is an INTERNAL key (modelchain chain key,
// `personas/<id>.md`, workmate meta.baseId) that legacy callers may still pass; it is
// accepted for compatibility and never advertised: a role is described by what it does.
// Keep the two vocabularies one word apart, never two spellings of the same thing.
// Persona texts are assets under personas/<id>.md resolved relative to this
// plugin's package location.
